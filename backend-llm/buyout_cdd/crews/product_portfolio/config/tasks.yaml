  description: >
    Analyze the value proposition, strategic pillars, and the product/price structure of the company {company_name}.
    
    Research:
    - The overarching value proposition of the company (max. 10 words)
    - The main strategic pillars (e.g., Household, Pharmacy, Vitamins, Sports, Beauty)
    - For each pillar:
        • Example product types
        • Pricing strategy as a list of bullet points (e.g., "Low priced", "Mostly private label", ...)

    Return a **fully custom JSON object** (and nothing else) in the following structure:

    {
      "title": "...", <- Brief statement about {company_name}'s product portfolio structure
      "value_proposition": "...", 
      "pillars": [
        {
          "name": "...",
          "products": [ "..." ],
          "price_strategy": [ "..." ]
        },
        ...
      ],
      "source": "https://...",
      "source_name": "..."
    }

    Notes:
    - The `title` should briefly summarize the structure and scope of {company_name}'s product portfolio (e.g., "Target’s product portfolio spans five strategic pillars across Health and Beauty")
    - Do **not** copy any example values from this prompt
    - All values must be **individually researched** and **specific** to {company_name}
    - Use only trustworthy and publicly available sources
    - Include **no more than 5 strategic pillars**
    - Return **only** the JSON – no explanations, no example data, no text outside the JSON

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object of type `ProductPortfolio`, including a tailored title referring to the product portfolio, a value proposition (max. 10 words), up to 5 company-specific product pillars with examples and pricing strategies, and a valid source.
