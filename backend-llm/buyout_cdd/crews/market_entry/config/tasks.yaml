market_entry_assessment_task:
  description: >
    Research publicly available information to identify countries that are particularly attractive for expansion in the {industry} market.

    Evaluate **at least 10 countries**, ideally more, based on the following criteria:
    - **Attractiveness**: Market potential, size, and growth prospects (scale 1–9)
    - **Ease of Entry**: Regulatory landscape, competitive intensity, and market accessibility (scale 1–9)
    - **Focus**: Whether the company should currently target this country, consider it for the future, or exclude it due to lack of potential 
      (choose from: "current", "future", "no_potential")

    Important:
    - Each country must have a **unique combination** of `attractiveness` and `ease_of_entry`.
    - No two countries may share the exact same (attractiveness, ease_of_entry) pair.

    Additionally, provide:
    - **Title**: A concise summary sentence to use as a headline for a presentation slide, e.g., 
      "Northern European markets appear most promising for {company_name}" – this should reflect the main strategic insight.
    - **Future Markets Comment**: A **short phrase** (max. one sentence) explaining the rationale behind selecting future markets. 
      For example: "Managerial resources, financial priorities, and strategic fit."

    Return a **valid JSON object** that adheres to the structure of the `MarketEntryAssessment` model.

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with:
    - `title` as a concise summary sentence
    - `evaluated_markets` as a list of country assessments
    - `future_markets_comment` as a brief rationale for future focus countries
