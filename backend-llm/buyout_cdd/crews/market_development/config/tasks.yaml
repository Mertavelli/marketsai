get_market_development_task:
  description: >
    Use web search (e.g., Statista, reports, market analyses) to research how the market volume of the {industry} sector has developed 
    over the past years in the countries {country_primary} and {country_secondary}.

    Return a **complete JSON object** matching the following schema, and **nothing else** (no comments, no text):

    {
      "title": "Germany and Netherlands have shown relatively high growth rates, though slower than European health and beauty market",
      "markets": [
        {
          "title": "Germany has exhibited steady growth in last five years, especially in Health category",
          "market": "{industry}",
          "country": "{country_primary}",
          "unit": "bn EUR",
          "data": [
            { "year": 2019, "value": 4.1 },
            { "year": 2020, "value": 5.3 }
          ],
          "source": "https://...",
          "source_name": "Statista"
        },
        {
          "title": "Netherlands has also seen steady growth, driven primarily by Beauty category",
          "market": "{industry}",
          "country": "{country_secondary}",
          "unit": "bn USD",
          "data": [
            { "year": 2019, "value": 6.1 },
            { "year": 2020, "value": 6.9 }
          ],
          "source": "https://...",
          "source_name": "McKinsey"
        }
      ]
    }

    Requirements:
    - Always return exactly **two entries** in the "markets" array – one for each country.
    - If public data is missing, use logic-based extrapolation – but do not skip an entry.
    - The "market" value must be a **single, concise word** (e.g., "Manufacturing", "Retail", "Logistics").

  expected_output: >
    A JSON object of type `MarketDevelopmentAll`, containing exactly two complete market development entries with titles.
